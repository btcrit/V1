                            Meetings are on Tuesday evenings. We'll discuss
                            assorted things, go on field trips to a cafe, and
                            every once in a while have a guest speaker.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hack Nights are on Fridays. We'll drag out our
                            laptops to build websites (like this one), have
                            trade-bot competitions, and other general activites.
                        </p>

                        <h1>We Like Cryptocurrencies.</h1>
                        <p>
                            From Bitcoin to Destler Dubloons, we'll discuss it
                            all. Big blocks vs Off-Chain Transactions? Traditional
                            blockchains or DAG-based? You decide.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also like decentralized systems in general. IPFS
                            is the next internet and I2P is the next internet.
                            TOR is the next internet, and Ethereum with be
                            the next internet.
